## What this is

This is not a note-taking app.  
This is not a productivity system.  
This is not a learning tracker.

This is a **personal land**.

A place where I decide:
- which ideas deserve to be planted,
- which projects deserve time,
- which failures deserve to be remembered,
- and which encounters deserve a flower.

## The rules of this land

1. **Everything starts from the land.**  
   No lists. No dashboards. No shortcuts.

2. **A tree must have a reason to be planted.**  
   An idea. A goal. A reading insight. Or a project.

3. **A project must face time.**  
   Every project has a deadline.  
   Miss it, and the tree withers.

4. **Failure is not deleted.**  
   It is reviewed once, and kept.

5. **Meeting a person leaves a flower.**  
   Not an analysis.  
   Just a trace of a real encounter.

## What will grow here

- 🌱 Trees for judgments I chose to commit to  
- 🌸 Flowers for people I chose to remember  
- 🌍 A forest that reflects how I actually lived, not what I planned
